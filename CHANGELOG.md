```

```php
// PHP
toast()
    ->debug('I will NOT show in production! Locally, I will also log in console...', 'A Debug Message')
    ->push();

// debug also accepts objects as message

    ->push();
```

## 1.2.0 - 2021-11-09

-   **[FEATURE]** Sanitization of the toast title and message is now optional, and enabled by default.

```php
// PHP
toast()
    ->danger('I will goâ€¦<br><i>to the next line ðŸ’ª</i>', 'I am <span style="color:red;">HOT</span>')
    ->doNotSanitize()
    ->push();
```

IF you have previously published the vendor views, you should re-publish them, or just change `x-text` to `x-html`
inside `includes\content.blade.php`
